### 3. User Interface Enhancements

## Default User Accounts
The system has the following default accounts for testing:

1. **Test Admin (Owner)**
   - Email: test@test.com
   - Password: test123
   - Role: owner

## Next Steps
1. Add further validation to ensure proper API responses
2. Implement the POS system as discussed
3. Continue to monitor for any further errors

To further diagnose any issues, check the browser console logs during operation and the server logs for any backend errors.
